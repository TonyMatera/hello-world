# hello-world
Baby's first repository


Greetings, fellow GitHubbers!

This is my first commit of the README file. I was instructed to do so in the tutorial,
so here we are. If you are reading this, then you must have been curious as to how
the editing process is going, and I must say, it's going rather well.

Just look at all these words I'm typing! I can't wait to commit these changes,
and then merge the readme-edits branch back into my master branch.

Funny how they call the branch a "master", wouldn't you say? They make it sound like the main
branch is in charge, when in fact I am the one in charge. Could you call me the master?
Or am I the master of the master? What name would I have then? Supreme chancellor?

All philosophical debates aside, I should probably wrap it up soon. I believe this readme
file is getting long enough, and I have probably used up a decent amount of time, unless
you are a very quick reader. In which case, I applaud your above-average literacy.
Jolly good show, reader. Jolly good.

Sincerely,
Supreme Chancellor TonyMatera
